## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to include Google Fonts in a project that is styled using TailwindCSS. One of the things that fascinates me about programming is learning how to do little things, which themselves produce far-reaching effects.

I also learned how to start the Tailwind CLI build process. Working with frameworks, it's easy to forget that there are processes under the hood. Taking my time to read the terminal command gave me an idea of how the framework compiles the classes and renders the styles.

I got comfortable with configuring Tailwind as I restricted myself to strictly using the framework. I was able to add custom colors and font. I also used classes for media-queries.

### Continued development

I specifically took on this project to sharpen my CSS skills. While I am pleased with the progress I have made with understanding CSS flexbox, I believe there is still plenty room for improvement. On that note, I would also like to pay more attention to CSS grids. I'm a little miffed that I didn't scrounge up the courage to use the concept in this code base. 

I would like to pay more attention to my commits and comments. I believe they left much to be desired on this project. I understand that comments aid code legibility, while commits, when done properly, improve debugging, task tracking and accountability. As such, I will be more intentional about these in coming projects.

### Useful resources

- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) - I believe this to be one of the most powerful resources currently in my arsenal. It is chuck full of documentation on most programming languages, libraries and frameworks. Plus, it works offline and on mobile
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - The TailwindCSS documentation is very well written and covers practically all use-cases for the framework.
- [Hatchet article](https://hatchet.com.au/blog/how-to-use-google-fonts-in-tailwind-css/) - This article taught me how to include the Google Font needed for the project.
